I'm a noob coder, I mainly do HTML, CSS, JS, and JSON. Open-source addict and privacy fiend. I must have OCD for trying to figure out how *everything* works...

Currently working on a LG style Heliboard theme and figuring out GitHub lol

Sorry if I'm too "helpful". That's kinda just my personality Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
